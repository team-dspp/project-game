# Project Game
Prototype for a web-based RPG.

## Developing on the frontend

There is a `gulpfile` with some basic tasks already defined. When developing on the frontend,
start by using the terminal to `cd` into the frontend folder. There, do the following:
 
    gulp watch
    
The `watch`task will be on the lookout for any file change and will re-compile the project on those events.
